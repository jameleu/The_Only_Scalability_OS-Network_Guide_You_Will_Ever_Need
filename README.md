# Scalability - OS And Network Guide
Beginner to Intermediate-advanced guide created to help self and others learn more about scalability and reliability, along with site reliability and system design topics.
Deep dives into how network packets are handled, LS, linking, memory, file systems, and context switches/scheduling at OS-level. Networking includes different protocols, version differences between HTTP 1 vs 2 vs 3 and TLS versions, along with system design of Youtube and other common platforms. 

Good for curious programmers looking to improve their knowledge of scalable systems and micro-optimizations, SRE and scalability interviews, or Linux lovers. Probably not the best for academic level higher than masters...
Very heavily built off of Brendan Gregg's blog and Systems Performance book.

## How to use:
* Summaries sections for OS and Troubleshooting are condensed versions with helpful thinking frameworks instead of just a bunch of sections for different topics - ~15-25 pages each
  * Network/System Design notes in here too; is inbetween deep dive and summary, is around ~50 pages
* Deeper dives/notes from Brendan Greg's Blog/book + Other Classical OS Textbooks in Deeper Dives folder (OS, Troubleshooting) - ~50+ pages
